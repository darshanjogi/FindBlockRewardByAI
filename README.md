# FindBlockRewardByAI  üìä

Overview
The Ethereum Block Reward Predictor is a project that combines a Node.js server (Server.js) and a machine learning script (ml.py) to fetch, process, and predict future Ethereum block rewards. It provides a streamlined way to gather historical block reward data and leverage machine learning to forecast potential rewards.


## How it Works üõ†Ô∏è

Node.js Server (Server.js):

Fetches Ethereum block reward data from Etherscan API.
Processes the data and exports it to a CSV file (block_data.csv).
Runs- node server.js 

Machine Learning Script (ml.py):

Reads block_data.csv and loads it into a Pandas DataFrame.
Visualizes the data with a scatter plot.
Trains a Random Forest Regressor to predict future block rewards.
Outputs the predicted block reward for a given timestamp.
